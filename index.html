    <h1>A Guide to Incorporating Dance with Physical Therapy </h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Based on observation of patients with PD</p>
    <p class="subtitle"><strong>by Kyla Kikkawa</strong></p>

    <hr> 
    <p class="content" id="introduction">In creating this guide, I hope to express why dance is a great addition to pre-existing physical therapy work and how to make this jump with our patients. These concepts can be applied in group settings or individually. </p>
    <p class="content" id="single-most">Before getting started, remember that encouraging movement modification is the single most important thing in making the shift from PT to dance. </p>

    <h2>Why is dance a great addition to a physical therapy space? </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If a space where physical therapy is being offered already exists, it is fundamental to introduce the incorporation of dance based on its physical and mental benefits.</li>
        <li>Compared to PT, dance activates many more regions than only structured exercise and can be a great way to combine physical activity and working memory exercises.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Plan to utilize the base provided by physical therapy to encourage and maintain focus on balance, alignment, and posture. </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Dance is a non-pharmacological intervention which can greatly impact maintenance of quality of life and functional independence for people with PD (PPD). More than other interventions, dance has been known to benefit in the realms of gait, balance, and psychosocial behavior.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How do we make this jump with our patients?</h2>
    <p class="content" id="jump">As previously noted, it is crucial that you expand on the following: <strong>If it doesn’t feel good, don’t do it! </strong>To say this in an alternative way, you can encourage your patients to lean into and return to the movements and positions that feel good to them! More than anything, you should prioritize the fun of the exercise and the dance. </p>
    <p class="content" id="incorporate">If you have little background in dance or don't consider yourself a dancer, don’t fret! You can still incorporate dance into your space in one of the following ways: </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Prioritize the music:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Consider eras, artists, and genres to highlight. Your patients will truly have a great time if you consider their desires in your music choices! </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Consider the movement itself:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>There are several ways in which the presented movement itself can be beneficial to PPD, in both choreographed and improvisational movement. Both are opportunities to empower your patients.</li>
                <li>One method developed by collaborators from Wake Forest University created IMPROVment, a framework which emphasizes proposing "a method of physical problem solving that enables students to develop more positive responses to psychophysical challenges faced in everyday living" (Batson et al., 2016).</li>
                <ul> <li>While learning the IMPROVment method itself (an auditory cueing framework) takes time and training, their five principles relating to movement give lots of insight into how to use movement that is conducive for growth in this population. The principles are:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Multitasking</li>
                        <li>Homolateral versus Contralateral</li>
                        <li>Movement Quality</li>
                        <li>Time-based exercises</li>
                        <li>Stretching</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>Applying any of these principles, even to choreographed movement, will create an opportunity to both empower and challenge each of your patients.

                </ul>

            </ul>
        <li>Consider how the other PT exercises you can complement how you are teaching dance in your space:</li>
            <ul> <li>Consider ways to translate movement or feelings from PT exercises to dance, or creative and expressive movement.</li>
            </ul>

    </ol>
