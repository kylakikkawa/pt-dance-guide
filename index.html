    <p class="content" id="introduction">In creating this guide, I hope to express why dance is a great addition to pre-existing physical therapy work and outline different approaches on how to make this transition with our patients. The concepts outlined in this guide can be applied in group settings or individually. Before getting started, remember that encouraging <strong>movement modification </strong>is the most important thing to prioritize in making the shift from PT to dance.</p>

    <div class="content" id="why-dance">
        <h2>Why is dance a great addition to a physical therapy space? </h2>
    <ol class="content">
        <li>Dance is a non-pharmacological intervention which can greatly impact maintenance of quality of life and functional independence for people with PD (PPD). More than other interventions, dance has been known to benefit PPD in the realms of gait, balance, and psychosocial behavior.</li>
        <li>Compared to PT, dance activates many more regions than standard structured exercise, and it has been shown to be more conducive for neuroplasticity than repetitive exercise (Rehfeld et al., 2018). In a traditional choreography setting, dance can be a great way to combine physical activity and working memory exercises. </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Plan to utilize the base provided by physical therapy to encourage and maintain focus on balance, alignment, and posture. </li>
            </ul>
        <li>If a space where physical therapy is being offered already exists, it is fundamental to introduce the incorporation of dance based on its physical and mental benefits.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="content" id="make-jump">
        <h2>How do we make this jump with our patients?</h2>
        <p class="content" id="jump">As previously noted, it is crucial that you expand on the following: <strong>If it doesn’t feel good, don’t do it! </strong>To say this in an alternative way, you can encourage your patients to lean into and return to the movements and positions that feel good to them! More than anything, you should prioritize the fun of the exercise and the dance. </p>
        <p class="content" id="incorporate">If you have little background in dance or don't consider yourself a dancer, don’t fret! You can still incorporate dance into your space in one of the following ways: </p>

        <ol class="content" id="steps">
            <li class="step">Prioritize the music:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consider eras, artists, and genres to highlight. Your patients will truly have a great time if you consider their desires in your music choices! </li>
                </ul>
            <li class="step">Consider the movement itself:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are several ways in which the presented movement itself can be beneficial to PPD, in both choreographed and improvisational movement. Both are opportunities to empower your patients.</li>
                    <li>One method developed by collaborators from Wake Forest University created IMPROVment, a framework which emphasizes proposing "a method of physical problem solving that enables students to develop more positive responses to psychophysical challenges faced in everyday living" (Batson et al., 2016).</li>
                    <ul> <li>While learning the IMPROVment method itself (an auditory cueing framework) takes time and training, their five principles relating to movement give lots of insight into how to use movement that is conducive for growth in this population. The principles are:</li>
                        <ol class="list" id="principles">
                            <li>Multitasking</li>
                            <li>Homolateral versus Contralateral</li>
                            <li>Movement Quality</li>
                            <li>Time-based exercises</li>
                            <li>Stretching</li>
                        </ol>
                        <li>Applying any of these principles, even to choreographed movement, will create an opportunity to both empower and challenge each of your patients. For more information and resources on these movement-based concepts, visit the American Parkinson Disease Association (APDA) website on IMPROVment <a href="https://www.apdaparkinson.org/community/st-louis/resources-support-stl/exercise-2/improvment/">here</a>.</li>
                    </ul>
    
                </ul>
            <li class="step">Consider how the other PT exercises you can complement how you are teaching dance in your space:</li>
                <ul> <li>Consider ways to translate movement or feelings from PT exercises to dance, or creative and expressive movement, especially considering strength training, postural alignment, and weight-shifting movements.</li>
                    <li>Utilize parameters such as the size of movement and the speed to increase or decrease the difficulty of movement.</li>
                    <li>Contemplate how PT and dance exercises can complement each other in terms of the heaviness or tension of the movement, the part of body, and muscle engagement.</li>
                </ul>
        </ol>

    <p class="stuck">If you get stuck, that's okay! The priority is that you find ways to make the PT exercises translational to expressive movement, and a large part of this will be attributed to your own attitude and encouragement.</p>

    <p class="content" id="last-part">Remember to open a line of communication with your patients as you try new things–ask for feedback but also don't expect your patients to have anything to offer but their subjective experience. Hopefully you too will grow in your movement as you help empower others in a new way!</p>
